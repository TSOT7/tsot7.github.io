description: The one factor that held me back in many areas of my life

All throughout my life I struggled immensely with comparing myselves to others. This problem is even more apparant now that I am studying computer science. The term for this is **imposter syndrome**, and it affects many STEM students who struggle with comparing themselves to others. 

I find that it often affects my productivity, when I feel like I have to be in the optimal enviroment, mood, energy levels, time of day, day of the week, week of the month, month of the year to be able to get things done. But this problem I had highlighted another very significant problem that rooted from it, that being perfectionism.

I was always under the impression that if I wasn't up for studying that day or if I felt like I wasn't in the optimal enviroment to be productive, then I just wouldn't do anything that day. This problem carried throughout all of high school for me, it led to me being unhappy and overall a mediocre student. Because 90% of the time, I did not feel like studying. 

The paradigm shift for me was when I was reading Atomic Habits by James Clear. Clear talks about the power of repetition of perfectionism, the main delemna that I was dealing with. He states that the frequency of doing something matters more than the intensity or duration. As long as something gets done, then its much better than doing nothing at all 
And then I discovered the idea of **non zero days**, Everyday, I should be doing something that gets me closer to my goals in life, it doesn't matter if its for 3 hours a day or 30 minutes. As long as I did something that day, then it would be a **non zero day**
