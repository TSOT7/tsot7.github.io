## Dopamine Detox: Reclaiming Focus and Control Over My Life

For the past few months, I’ve been on a mission to break free from the endless cycle of distraction and regain control over my focus and productivity. Like many people, I found myself stuck in a loop of mindless scrolling, seeking quick dopamine hits from social media, YouTube, and other digital distractions. What started as an occasional break turned into a habit that chipped away at my ability to concentrate on the things that truly matter—my studies, projects, fitness, and personal growth.

### Why I Started a Dopamine Detox

I’ve always been interested in using technology to enhance my creativity, but I realized that tech was also my biggest enemy when it came to discipline. After watching a video on rewiring the subconscious, I started thinking about the direct link between focus and success. I wanted to build a system where studying, coding, and working on projects felt rewarding in themselves—not something I had to fight myself to do.

On top of that, I had been struggling with impulsive behaviors, whether it was quitting projects too early, getting sucked into scrolling late at night, or videogames. I wanted to reprogram my brain to enjoy deep work and long-term gains instead of chasing short-term pleasure.

### The Rules of My Dopamine Detox

I didn’t want to go to the extreme of eliminating all entertainment, but I knew I needed structure. Here are the main rules I set for myself:

**No social media on my phone** – I kept Instagram only on my laptop, removing the instant accessibility.

**Blocking distractions** – I started using blocking software such as JOMO and Cold Turkey Blocker to prevent the use of willpower.

**Replacing scrolling with reading** – I wanted to make reading my new default activity at night instead of doomscrolling.

**Journaling progress** – I track my habits, fitness, and reflections daily, reinforcing the mindset shift with real data.

**Priming my brain for deep work** – Instead of associating studying with stress or obligation, I condition myself to link it directly to success and happiness using Pavlovian reinforcement.

### How You Can Follow Along

I would strongly recommend anybody to try a dopamine detox at least once in their lives. Many may instantly repulse at the idea of doing a detox. They think that the point of technology is to offer these services at any time and restricting this may be infringing on their personal freedoms. But trust me, the clarity you will receive when you do this will be mind-blowing. You will start feeling like a kid again when every little thing feels like an adventure.

#### Follow the rules I created or make your own 

You don’t have to follow my exact detox plan—customize it based on what’s distracting you the most. Identify the habits that steal your focus and decide on rules that help you regain control. Whether it’s limiting social media, cutting down on gaming, or blocking distracting websites, the key is to be intentional and stick with it.


#### Choose duration 

A dopamine detox isn’t an all-or-nothing challenge. You can start with a short trial—maybe a single weekend or a full week—to see how it affects you. From there, decide whether to extend it to a month or even make it a long-term lifestyle change. The goal is to rewire your brain to appreciate delayed gratification instead of seeking constant stimulation.


#### Create alternatives 

To make the detox sustainable, replace your old habits with meaningful activities:

**Doomscrolling → Reading** – Instead of passively consuming random content, I switched to reading books that engage my mind and help me grow.

**Video games → Coding projects** – Gaming gave me instant rewards, but coding gives me a sense of accomplishment that lasts longer.

**Mindless YouTube → Watching educational content** – I still watch videos, but I choose ones that align with my goals, like learning new coding skills or understanding business strategies.

**Late-night social media → Journaling** – Instead of scrolling before bed, I reflect on my day and track my progress.

By replacing distractions with purposeful activities, you make it easier to stick with the detox while improving your life in the process.

### Results

Overall, I am more happy and present in the moment. Eventually my brain stopped begging to reach for any hit of dopamine when I was bored. I was more comfortable with just doing nothing and being bored.
