description: How I made my devices distraction free
---
I know many students include myself struggle with managing our screen times. We socialize, study, and find entertainment through our screens. It's hard to set boundaries between work and play when we use our devices to do everything. That is why I developed  systaem to limit my time on distracting apps and keep myself focused on school 

### Overview 
I use a variety of apps and extensions across all my devices to ensure that every device follows the philosophy. 

### Phone and iPad
* Jomo
* UnTrap for Youtube
* SocialFocus

### Laptop
* ColdTurkey Blocker
* Unhook Youtube extension 
* uBlock origin
* SocialFocus extension
